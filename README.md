# Conversimg
An open-source image converter and resizer

## 1 - Description

Conversimg is an open-source application whose purpose is to allow the user to convert and resize images locally without having to
resort to external services on the Internet.

## 2 - Supported formats

Conversimg works with the most standardized image formats. The supported formats are the following:

* BMP (Windows bitmap).
* JPG (Joint Photographic Experts Group).
* GIF (Graphic Interchange Format).
* PNG (Portable Network Graphics).

More formats will be added in later versions.

## 3 - Source code

The application has been developed in a **gradle project (version 5.6.2)** in **java programming language**. The application has
three files written in java to model the converter, the resizer and the main control module. The files are documented to make 
them as easy to understand as possible.
